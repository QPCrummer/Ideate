# Ideate
Capitalism is great; Everything should be patented!

This mod allows recipes to be "patented", requiring users to research the recipe in the Ideator to unlock the recipe inside of the Fabricator. This is good for gating content in a modpack or making some recipes harder to obtain.

This is an addon for Create Fabric for 1.20.1. A Forge port may be considered later.

**This mod is a WIP!**
